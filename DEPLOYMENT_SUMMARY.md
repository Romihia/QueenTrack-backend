# QueenTrack Backend - Deployment Summary

## âœ… What We've Set Up

### 1. **Production Environment File** (`.env.production`)

- Clean production environment without AWS variables
- Includes: Database, Email, AI models, Performance settings
- Ready for production deployment

### 2. **Updated CI/CD Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- **Stage Branch**: Runs tests only
- **Main Branch**: Runs tests + deploys to production
- Uses GitHub Secrets for secure deployment
- Automatic deployment with `docker-compose up --build`

### 3. **GitHub Secrets Required**

Set these in your GitHub repository settings:

```
PRODUCTION_HOST     = 162.55.53.52 (your server IP)
PRODUCTION_USER     = root (your server username)
PRODUCTION_SSH_KEY  = (your private SSH key)
```

### 4. **Deployment Script** (`.github/scripts/deploy.sh`)

- Handles server-side deployment
- Pulls latest code from GitHub main branch
- Uses docker-compose.prod.yml for production
- Includes health checks and error handling

### 5. **Production Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`)

- Optimized for production use
- Includes health checks and logging
- Uses production environment variables

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Push to `main` branch** â†’ Triggers GitHub Actions
2. **GitHub Actions** â†’ Connects to your server via SSH
3. **Server** â†’ Pulls latest code from GitHub
4. **Docker** â†’ Builds and runs containers with `docker-compose up --build`
5. **Service** â†’ Available on port 8000

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Add GitHub Secrets** (see DEPLOYMENT_SETUP.md)
2. **Prepare your server** (install Docker, Git)
3. **Test deployment** by pushing to main branch
4. **Monitor** your production service

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

After setup, every push to `main` branch will automatically:

- Pull latest code to your server
- Build fresh Docker images
- Deploy to production
- Verify the deployment worked

**Production URL**: `http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:8000`
